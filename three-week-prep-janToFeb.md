|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | React.js Fundamentals           | Learn components, props, state, and hooks (useState, useEffect).                           |
| Day 2 | React Router and Context API    | Add routing with React Router and learn Context API for shared state management.           |
| Day 3 | Redux Basics                    | Use Redux Toolkit for global state management in a basic app.                              |
| Day 4 | Styling Frontend                | Learn Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap. Apply styles to your app.                                 |
| Day 5 | TypeScript with React           | Integrate TypeScript into your React project. Learn types and interfaces.                  |
| Day 6 | Complete Frontend Project       | Build a styled app (e.g., task manager or portfolio) using React.js, Redux, and routing.   |
| Day 7 | Revision and Optimization       | Debug your code and optimize performance (React.memo, lazy loading).                       |

## Week 2: Backend with Java + Spring Boot  
**Goal:** Build REST APIs using Java and Spring Boot, integrate with PostgreSQL.

| Day   | Topic                           | Tasks                                                                                       |
|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Java Basics + Spring Boot Setup | Learn core Java (OOP, Collections). Set up a Spring Boot project and create a REST API.    |
| Day 2 | Spring Boot + PostgreSQL        | Use JPA/Hibernate for database CRUD operations with PostgreSQL.                            |
| Day 3 | Building REST APIs              | Dive deeper into REST API design, request handling, and error handling in Spring Boot.     |
| Day 4 | Authentication (JWT)            | Implement JWT-based authentication in your Spring Boot project.                            |
| Day 5 | Database: PostgreSQL Advanced   | Learn indexing, transactions, and advanced queries in PostgreSQL.                          |
| Day 6 | Backend Project                 | Build an API with Spring Boot, connecting it to PostgreSQL.                                |
| Day 7 | Backend Optimization + Testing  | Test APIs with Postman. Debug and optimize your backend for performance.                   |

## Week 3: DevOps + Full-Stack Integration  
**Goal:** Learn Docker, deploy your applications, and integrate the frontend and backend into a full-stack project.

| Day   | Topic                           | Tasks                                                                                       |
|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Docker Basics                   | Learn Docker fundamentals. Containerize your backend app.                                  |
| Day 2 | Kubernetes Basics               | Deploy your Dockerized app on a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube).                       |
| Day 3 | Frontend-Backend Integration    | Connect the React.js frontend to the Spring Boot backend. Test and debug interactions.     |
| Day 4 | Advanced Deployment             | Explore deploying your full-stack app on Heroku, AWS, or a similar platform.               |
| Day 5 | Full-Stack Features             | Add advanced features like file uploads or notifications to your full-stack app.           |
